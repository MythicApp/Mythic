 Connecting to your Steam account using steamcmd is similar to using the
 regular Steam client UI. You can login, logout, and set your Steam Guard
 email code. Any other account management should be done using the Steam
 client UI.

 The first time logging in to a given account on this machine, you'll need to
 specify the password. For subsequent sessions you can omit the password;
 using the 'logout' command will clear those cached credentials (your
 password is never stored locally) and require a password on the next login.
 If the password is required but not supplied as part of the 'login' command,
 you will be prompted for a password. To disable this prompt, first set the
 '@NoPromptForPassword' ConVar to 1 (see the help topic 'convars' for more
 info). If the prompt is disabled and the password is required, the login
 command will fail.

 Note: you may login anonymously using "login anonymous" if the content you
 wish to download is available for anonymous access.
